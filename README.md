# Flashy!

*WARNING!* This web page may be a very bad idea for people with epilepsy
or prone to seizures. I'd also recommend not viewing it after extended
periods of no sleep as that's exactly how I've had a seizure.

You have been warned. Use at your own risk! But seriously, if you're
prone to seizures, please don't use this )':

## What is this?

A simple web page to help alleviate screen burn-in.

## Why?

Because I came home to find my screen burned-in after a driver update
apparently confused the power-saving features on my computer.

## How to use it?
Clone this repo or get a link to the static content online and load
the page in your favourite web browser (disclaimer: this is tested
in Chrome). Preferably go full-screen (press F11 on most browsers)
and leave your machine alone for a while. In my case, the ghosting
was sorted out in about 15 minutes. Longer periods may be required
for more serious ghosting and there may be ghosting that this can't
resolve. C'est la vie.

## How does it work?
It cycles through random colors every 10 milliseconds. I've read before
that this may alleviate screen burn-in, and this page did work to sort
out an obvious ghosting left on my screen. I make no claims that it will
work for everyone -- it just worked for me. Also, I accept no liability
for anything that results from using this, including, but not restricted
to seizures, exploding screens, missing cats or a serious case of the 
munchies.

## Does it actually work?
It worked for me (tm). YMMV.
